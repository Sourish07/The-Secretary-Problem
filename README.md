# The Secretary Problem

This repo contains the code for my YouTube video about the Secretary Problem. Check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyrAKlLs89o)!

`video_samples.py` contains the code used in the video, but `main.py` uses numpy for some major speed improvements. `parallel.py` uses multiprocessing to run the optimized simulations in parallel for even more performance gains.
